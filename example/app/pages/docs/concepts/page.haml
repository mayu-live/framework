      # Concepts

      Here are some ideas explained.

      ## Server-side Virtual DOM

      By running the application on the server, you have complete
      control over the environment in which it runs.

      You can communicate with your database directly from your
      app without having to implement an API inbetween.

      The only state that gets exposed to clients
      is the data you include in the DOM.

      Callbacks are regular POST-request with an identifier
      that maps to a component and a callback name.

      ## Deploy globally

      You can deploy Mayu to data centers around the world within
      minutes with very little configuration.

      Let's say you're making an app for finding lunch restaurants
      around the world. You would have traffic 24/7, but you would
      have more users in regions closer to lunch time.

      With Mayu, you would just increase the number of instances
      in those regions. New instances start within seconds.

      ## Resumability

      Before a server shuts down, it serializes the state and sends
      it to the browser, so that it can send it to another server
      and resume the state.

      Mayu restores the state of components automatically.
      Users shouldn't notice anything most of the time.

      However, if the user loses their connection for too long,
      the session will expire on the server, and they will have
      to start a new session.

      If you're making an app for users on shaky internet connections,
      then Mayu is probably not the right tool.

      ## Efficiency

      The browser runtime loads the chunk that makes the connection
      to the server first, and then loads remaining chunks asynchronously.
      This way, the browser can many times connect to the even stream
      before the page has even rendered.

      Mayu only updates the parts that have changed on a site.
      When you navigate to a different page, only the difference
      between the current page and the new page will be rendered
      and sent to the browser.

      Asset filenames are based on their content hash
      so that they can be cached very easily, and browsers
      will only have to download stylesheets and images etc
      that have changed since their last visit.

      Asset files are usually small and compressed when possible.
      Everything loads in parallel over HTTP/2 so bundling CSS-files
      together would actually only make things worse.

      Here are some screenshots showing how assets are loaded in Chrome.

      ## Metrics

      Mayu exposes a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoint with
      metrics that you can use to visualize how your app is performing.

      ## Easy to use

      Mayu is written in Ruby which is famous for being user friendly
      and has been used on the web for a very long time.

      Mayu uses [Haml](https://haml.info/about.html) in a similar way that
      [React uses JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html),
      which results in clean and simple markup in your components.

      Mayu was designed with hot reloading in mind from the start.
      This is a popular feature in many JavaScript build tools like
      [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
      and it makes web development really fun because of the fast
      feedback loop.

      ## Built for the future

      Mayu is using some new browser features and is not designed to
      work with current browsers, but for the browsers of next year.

      [DecompressionStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DecompressionStream)
      is used to compress the event stream. Not supported everywhere,
      although [polyfilled](https://github.com/mayu-live/framework/blob/main/lib/mayu/client/src/DecompressionStreamPolyfill.ts)
      using the very small [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate) library.

      This website uses the [`has()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)-selector,
      which can be used to do things you would normally have to use JavaScript for.
      [Check out this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGJvhpoE8b4 "I never thought this would be possible with CSS")
      where [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) shows how to make
      some really cool validations with only HTML and CSS.

      The [Navigation API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/navigation-api/)
      will be very useful once supported everywhere.
      [There is an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mayu-live/framework/issues/12).

      [CSS Module Scripts](https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/)
      should probably be used for loading CSS as soon as
      [Firefox ships support for Import Assertions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1777526)
