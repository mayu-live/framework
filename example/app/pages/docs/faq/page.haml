  %Heading(level=2) Frequently asked questions

  %p Here are some questions people have asked.

  %Details.details(summary="Will not latency be a problem?")
    %p
      It depends. For a regular web page, users would probably not
      notice any more latency than with any other framework, but
      if you have a lot of interactive components, it might be
      annoying for the user if they are on a stable connection.
    %p
      Many modern websites today require a connection to work at all.
      Mayu is designed to be deployed on servers near your users,
      that could be on
      %Link(href="https://fly.io/")< Fly.io
      or an on-premise Raspberry PI.
    %p
      If the ping time is around 50-60ms, latency is barely noticable.
      100ms is manageable, and if it's higher it can get annoying.
    %p
      There are a few ways to make things seem faster, by preloading stuff
      while hiding them (such as the
      %Link(href="/demos/form")< form example
      ), and using other HTML/CSS-tricks.
    %p
      In the future, it would be nice to have support for
      %Link(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements")< Custom elements
      , but no work has been done on this yet.

  %Details.details(summary="What happens to sessions during deploy?")
    %p
      Clients will be transferred automatically to a new server.
    %p
      Before a server shuts down, it will pause all sessions,
      serialize and encrypt them, and send them to each client.
    %p
      The client will then send the encrypted session to another
      server which will decrypt and verify the data before deserializing
      and resuming the session.

  %Details.details(summary="What if the user loses their connection?")
    %p
      Usually they will just reconnect and the session will be resumed.
      I don't know how this works if an app is deployed to different regions.
    %p
      Sessions are cleared after a few seconds of disconnectivity,
      so if the session can't be found, the user will get an error
      dialog and the only option is to reload the page.
    %p
      %Link(href="https://github.com/mayu-live/framework/issues/20")> Issue #20
      could remove the need to reload the page by serializing the current
      browser DOM and deserializing it on the server and then use that as
      a reference for patching.
